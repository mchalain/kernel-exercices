This driver reads a register range address from the devicetree.
It creates a parameter to set the offset into this range.
And /dev/mydriveX allows to read/write this register.

Exercice 1:
  build the driver:
   > make
  push the driver on the target
   > scp *.ko *.dtbo root@<addr>:~
  load the driver on the target
   > insmod mydriver1.ko
  load the DT overlay on the target
   > dtoverlay mydevice1.dtbo
  select a register offset
   > echo 0x40 > /sys/devices/platform/7e300000.mydevice/driver/module/parameters/offset
  read the driver
   > cat /dev/mydriver0
  change the offset and read the new value
  as you can see, it is hasardous to access on a hardware with out knowledge about it.
