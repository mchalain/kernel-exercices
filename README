The first step is to retrieve the GPIO from the devicetree.
After to request this GPIO, anyother driver are not able to attach to it.
The GPIO must be set as an input or an output (here as input to read the value.
The state of the GPIO must be read when the user reads on the misc interface.
Exercice 1:
 Build the driver:
  > make
 upload the driver and the dtbo on the target
  > scp *.dtbo *.ko root@<addr>:~
 load the driver
  > insmod mydriver1.ko
 load the device tree overlay
  > dtoverlay mydevice1.dtbo
 read the GPIO state:
  > cat /dev/mydriver0

The current driver return alway 0, looks for the function to use and place it,
into the good function.
