Exercice 1:
 build the driver:
 > make
 Load the driver :
 > sudo insmod mydriver1.ko

Exercice 2:
 Modify the driver to read data from the device. Use the function :

``` C
	int i2c_master_send(struct i2c_client *client, unsigned char *buffer, int bufferlen);
	int i2c_master_recv(struct i2c_client *client, unsigned char *buffer, int bufferlen);
```

 The protocol to read data:
	send(memory_address);
	recv(one_byte);

Exercice 3:
 The device may respond to any command from the master, at least with an error.
 Then it is possible to detect a device.
 It is possible to dispatch the detection and the probing when the address is unknown.
 Remove "i2c_new_device" and use the "detect" method of the driver in the same place of the probe method.
