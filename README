The GPIO is set as an IRQ and a handler is atttached to it.

Exercice 1:
 Build the driver:
  > make
 upload the driver and the dtbo on the target
  > scp *.dtbo *.ko root@<addr>:~
 load the driver
  > insmod mydriver1.ko
 load the device tree overlay
  > dtoverlay mydevice1.dtbo
 read the GPIO state:
  > cat /dev/mydriver0

The handler is called every time even if the device is closed.
Change the place of request_irq into the open function.
