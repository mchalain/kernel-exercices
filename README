The IRQ handler must be the fastest as possible and may not access to writeable memory.
This driver add a bottomhalf process.

Exercice 1:
 Build the driver:
  > make
 upload the driver and the dtbo on the target
  > scp *.dtbo *.ko root@<addr>:~
 load the driver
  > insmod mydriver1.ko
 load the device tree overlay
  > dtoverlay mydevice1.dtbo
 read the GPIO state:
  > cat /dev/mydriver0

Create a buffer to write into the tasklet and push the data during the read function.
